It's huge so it helps to focus on some small area. Now this might seem obvious, but I know to my beginner self it was not. My go to strategy for finding something in such a large code base is to search for some text at/near what I want to change and go from there. I do not really try to understand the organization of the project. Enough will emerge from looking at related files to understand what I need. Usually it is not more than a couple of files that you'll need to look at to change something.",[56,89,90],{},"When in doubt there was also the very helpful Krita dev IRC chat to point me in the right direction.",[56,92,93],{},"The C++ was not as scary as I thought it would be. It's not like you have to deal with pointers or memory management that much at all. You just have to get used to the syntax and using header files and that's about it. The key really is to have your editor setup properly so you have autocomplete. There's a note on how to do that in the readme of the scripts I published.",[56,95,96],{},"Krita is built Qt so it also helped have the Qt docs open at all times.",[56,98,99,100,105],{},"As I made small fixes, I used ",[69,101,104],{"href":102,"rel":103},"https://stacked-git.github.io/",[73],"stacked git"," to commit them.

Git worktrees if you've never used them, allow you to checkout a branch in a different folder. So I could have many separate branches and builds. I had one for my branch, one for the the master branch, and a third one just for checking out/navigating commits. This is because switching branches will trigger a complete rebuild and that would take 2-3 hours. So worktrees were a must. I could also setup multiple builds like this.",[56,116,117],{},"Next I moved on to the more difficult issue I wanted to tackle, the algorithm that laid out the popup palette brush slots.
