[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) was the closest, but it's missing an easier way to manager branches and the workflow seems more error prone to me.\n\n# Workaround\n\nThis is the simplest workaround I've found. Instead of the regular `feat/fix/...` commits, I create `v0feat/v0fix/...`. You could do this for all the commit types. I chose to just create three, `v0feat`, `v0fix`, `v0breaking`, and technically `v0fix` is not needed since it's the same as `fix`, but I liked the consistent naming. How you set this up, depends on what you'd like to bump what. Technically the only one you truly need is `v0breaking` so release notes show breaking changes without a major bump.\n\nNow I keep my own [semantic-release-config](https://github.com/AlansCodeLog/my-semantic-release-config/blob/master/release.config.js) so this was easier for me to do. You will need to either configure certain plugins manually each time or I highly suggest creating your own config and abstracting everything away (no more need to install all the deps/plugins needed, your config can just do it for you).\n\nHow to do so or the various places you can place your config is out of scope for this post.\n\nI'll just be showing you how to configure the plugins.\n\nFirst, [commit-analyzer](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer). This will tell semantic-release how much to bump.\n\n```jsonc\n[\n\t\"@semantic-release/commit-analyzer\",\n\t{\n\t\t// you can use a preset here if you like\n\t\t\"preset\": \"conventionalcommits\",\n\t\t\"releaseRules\": [\n\t\t\t{ \"type\": \"v0feat\", \"release\": \"patch\" },\n\t\t\t{ \"type\": \"v0fix\", \"release\": \"patch\" },\n\t\t\t{ \"type\": \"v0breaking\",  \"release\": \"minor\" }\n\t\t]\n\t}\n],\n```\n\nThen, [release-notes-generator](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator). This will tell semantic-release how to format the commit message headers. The docs for `presetConfig` are a bit hidden. You can find the full spec for them [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-config-spec)\n\n```jsonc\n[\n\t\"@semantic-release/release-notes-generator\",\n\t{\n\t\t// note that if you use a preset, you will inherit it's options regarding what text counts as breaking changes\n\t\t\"preset\": \"conventionalcommits\",\n\t\t\"presetConfig\": {\n\t\t\t\"types\": [\n\t\t\t\t{ \"type\":\"v0feat\", \"section\": \":star: New Features\" },\n\t\t\t\t{ \"type\": \"v0fix\", \"section\": \":bug: Fixes\" },\n\t\t\t\t// Simulate a breaking change\n\t\t\t\t{ \"type\": \"v0breaking\", \"section\": \":warning: BREAKING CHANGES\" }\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\n\t}\n]\n```\n\nYou can see the configs are pretty similar. In my config I create one shared object to pass as necessary to the plugins.\n\n\n# Usage\n\nFirst you will need to create your first commit. Usually I will just create an empty commit.\n\n\n```sh\ngit commit --allow-empty \"v0feat: empty\"\n```\nNow if you tried to run semantic release now, you would still get version v1.0.0. \n\nYou will need to tag the initial commit as v0.0.0 to trick semantic-release into working how we want.\n\n```sh\ngit tag v0.0.0\n# don't forget!\ngit push --tags \n```\n\nThen add your code and your real commit.\n```sh\ngit add .\ngit commit \"v0feat: initial\"\n```\n\nNow you can do a dry run. Note you will need to push to your repo before doing so. So disable your release workflow if you have one. I personally have an env variable `ENABLE_RELEASE` I use to enable/disable, which has not been enabled yet at this point.\n\n```sh\nnpx semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci #--debug\n```\n\nIt should now print v0.0.1!\n\nNow so long as you do not commit any commit types that trigger a major bump or use any text that triggers a breaking change in your commit messages (that's what `v0breaking` is for), you should stay in v0.\n\n\n",{"title":42,"description":441},[69,448,449],"build-tools","ci","jpTxQetCFYwKqAvzQqvJtMWm1Ke_plmRVUnHk5nzq90",[443,443],1770083875244]
