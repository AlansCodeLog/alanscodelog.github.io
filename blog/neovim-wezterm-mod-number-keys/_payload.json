And I think this time it's going to work out, but I really miss Modifier+Number shortcuts.\n\nUsually you cannot map to modifies + number keys in in neovim (e.g. Ctrl+1). You can [try to map the raw key sequences](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/19358/cannot-map-ctrl-number-except-6-or) but this is a pain and does not work for all numbers.\n\nThe best way to get around this is to map to an obscure keybinding then make the terminal remap Mod+Number to those odd keybindings. I never got around to actually doing this usually because most terminal's configs are static it's also often a pain to remap keys (e.g. [kitty, I like you, but...](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf/#shortcut-kitty.Send-arbitrary-text-on-key-presses))\n\nAlso the ideal way to do this is to map them to a key chain like `{ObscureCombo} {Mods}+{Remap}` so as to not take up useful keys. But that's even more painful.\n\nRecently though I tried and switched to [wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) for my terminal emulator, and it's configured through lua which makes this super easy to do for all sequences.\n\nFor example, I picked `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F12` for the obscure key combo and letters for the remap part. So `Ctrl+1` would map to `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F12 Ctrl+q`.\n\nThe letter mapping is to avoid breaking anything. If we mapped them to, for example, the F keys again, we might accidentally shoot ourselves in the foot when pressing `Alt+4` .\n\nNote that we also can't map the numbers without the modifiers, since wezterm has no way to know if we're in normal mode or not, and we would be left unable to type numbers if we did so.\n\nHere's my wezterm function for remapping with all mods.\n\n```lua\n-- Allows using Mods+Number in the receiving program if it does not support it.\n-- In the receiving program, the keymap needs to be `\u003CC-A-S-F12> \u003CMods-F{q-p}>`\nlocal remapModNumber = function(keyConfig, modsToRemap)\n\t-- it's not \u003CMods-F{Number}> for obvious reasons (i.e. A-F4)\n\tlocal numMap = {\n\t\t[\"1\"] = \"q\",\n\t\t[\"2\"] = \"w\",\n\t\t[\"3\"] = \"e\",\n\t\t[\"4\"] = \"r\",\n\t\t[\"5\"] = \"t\",\n\t\t[\"6\"] = \"y\",\n\t\t[\"7\"] = \"u\",\n\t\t[\"8\"] = \"i\",\n\t\t[\"9\"] = \"o\",\n\t\t[\"0\"] = \"p\",\n\t}\n\n\tlocal createModNumberRemap = function(key, mods)\n\t\tlocal res = {\n\t\t\tkey = key,\n\t\t\tmods = mods,\n\t\t\taction = act.Multiple({\n\t\t\t\t--obscure key to use as base\n\t\t\t\tact.SendKey({ key = \"F12\", mods = \"CTRL|SHIFT|ALT\" }),\n\t\t\t\tact.SendKey({ key = numMap[key], mods = mods }),\n\t\t\t}),\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn res\n\tend\n\tprint(keyConfig)\n\tfor i = 0, 9 do\n\t\tfor _, mod in ipairs(modsToRemap) do\n\t\t\t-- cant insert normally???\n\t\t\tkeyConfig[#keyConfig + 1] = createModNumberRemap(tostring(i), mod)\n\t\tend\n\tend\nend\nconfig.keys = {\n\t-- ...your other keybindings\n}\n\nremapModNumber(config.keys, { \"CTRL\", \"SHIFT\", \"ALT\", \"CTRL|ALT\", \"ALT|SHIFT\", \"CTRL|SHIFT\", \"ALT|CTRL\", \"CTRL|SHIFT|ALT\" })\n```\n\nThen in vim, if we wanted to use `\u003CC-1>` we would map to `\u003CC-S-A-F12>\u003CC-q>`.\n\nI've also added a small helper function in my local utils module to help with this. I might extract this later into a plugin.\n\n```lua\nlocal M = {}\nlocal config = {\n\tbaseSequence = \"\u003CC-S-A-F12>\",\n}\nM.setup = function(opts)\n\topts = opts or {}\n\tvim.tbl_extend(\"force\", config, opts)\nend\nlocal replacements = {\n\t[\"1\"] = \"q\",\n\t[\"2\"] = \"w\",\n\t[\"3\"] = \"e\",\n\t[\"4\"] = \"r\",\n\t[\"5\"] = \"t\",\n\t[\"6\"] = \"y\",\n\t[\"7\"] = \"u\",\n\t[\"8\"] = \"i\",\n\t[\"9\"] = \"o\",\n\t[\"0\"] = \"p\",\n}\nM.mapNum = function(keysString)\n\tlocal str = \"\"\n\tfor i = 1, #keysString do\n\t\tlocal prevPrevChar = i > 2 and keysString:sub(i - 2, i - 2) or nil\n\n\t\tlocal prevChar = i > 1 and keysString:sub(i - 1, i - 1) or nil\n\t\tlocal char = keysString:sub(i, i)\n\t\tlocal isNumber = tonumber(char) ~= nil\n\t\tlocal prevIsNumber = prevChar ~= nil and tonumber(prevChar) ~= nil\n\t\tlocal prevIsAllowed = prevChar == nil or prevChar ~= \"F\" or prevIsNumber\n\t\tlocal prevPrevIsAllowed = prevPrevChar == nil or prevPrevChar ~= \"F\"\n\t\tif isNumber and prevIsAllowed and prevPrevIsAllowed then\n\t\t\tstr = str .. replacements[char]\n\t\telse\n\t\t\tstr = str .. char\n\t\tend\n\tend\n\treturn config.baseSequence .. str\nend\n\nreturn M\n```\n\nIt can then be used like so:\n```lua\nlocal mn = require(\"utils\").mapNum\n\nvim.keymap.set(\"n\", mn(\"\u003CC-1>\"), ...)\n-- will not remap F1\nvim.keymap.set(\"n\", mn(\"\u003CC-F1>\"), ...) \n```\n\nHow to get a local module to actually load using lazy.nvim is out of scope for this post, but I might write one on that later because it was not very straightforward.\n",{"title":30,"description":647},null,[656,98],"neovim","JzZEzUM2UWLZvU3KZ-MB0cCLaAKIBeS3kam4p-ySotc",[654,654],1770083875246]
